# book-club-organiser
The Book Club Organiser will allow users to add books, schedule reading discussions, track reading progress, and mark books as completed. This project will use only Golang's standard libraries (no external web frameworks like gin, no ORMs like gorm) to build a fully functional CRUD web app with structured content management.
